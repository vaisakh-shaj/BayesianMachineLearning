# BayesianMachineLearning

Have Material On Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning. Discusses on inference techniques in Bayesian Settings which typically makes use of latent variables and priors. Will be updated soon with more info.

## Implementations
1) [Expectation Maximization and Gaussian Mixture Models](https://github.com/vaisakh-shaj/BayesianMachineLearning/blob/master/Expectation%20Maximization%20Assignment.ipynb)
2) [Gaussian Process and Bayesian Optimization](https://github.com/vaisakh-shaj/BayesianMachineLearning/blob/master/Guassian_Process%20And%20Bayesian_Optimization%20Assignment.ipynb)
3) [Variational Autoencoder and Conditional Variational Auto Encoder](https://github.com/vaisakh-shaj/BayesianMachineLearning/blob/master/Variational%20Autoecoder%20-%20Assignment.ipynb)
